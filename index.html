                ‚ÄúWhy I Chose Python Full Stack to Start My Web Journey‚Äù
When I began learning web development, I was overwhelmed by the choices. But I quickly found Python Full Stack to be the right fit ‚Äî with its clean syntax, powerful backend capabilities using frameworks like Flask or Django, and smooth integration with frontend tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This stack allowed me to build real-world projects like e-commerce websites and business landing pages. Through this journey, I‚Äôve realized that being a full stack developer gives me the creative freedom to build complete solutions, from database to design.

                ‚ÄúMy Transition from Coding to Data-Driven Problem Solving‚Äù
Coming from a programming background, I was always interested in logic and problem-solving. But data science opened up a new world ‚Äî where every dataset is a challenge waiting to be solved. I learned to use Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy, cleaned and visualized data, and even built dashboards in Power BI. What I love most is that data science combines logic with storytelling. I now look at data as a tool to find trends, improve decisions, and solve business problems creatively.

                ‚ÄúHow SQL Helped Me Understand Business Data Better‚Äù
While learning SQL, I realized it‚Äôs not just about querying rows ‚Äî it‚Äôs about understanding patterns in data. From simple SELECT statements to JOINs and GROUP BY operations, MySQL helped me explore large datasets and answer real business questions. I used it to clean retail data, find top-selling products, analyze customer behavior, and prepare it for visualization in tools like Power BI. Knowing SQL gave me the confidence to work with databases like a pro and speak the language of data.

                I recently conducted a session titled ‚ÄúGetting Started with Power BI‚Äù for juniors at Canara Engineering College. The goal was to introduce them to the basics of business intelligence and hands-on dashboard building.

I covered topics like data import, cleaning, and visualization, and walked them through building a simple sales dashboard. The session was interactive and well-received ‚Äî many students were eager to explore data analytics further.

This experience not only helped me grow as a speaker but also strengthened my own understanding of Power BI. Teaching truly is a powerful way to learn and give back.
